# Quick Start Guide

Get from zero to fully-configured Firebase project in minutes!

## What This Tool Does

Firebase Architect sets up your **complete development environment** - but does NOT generate application code. After setup, Claude Code builds all your features.

**Tool handles:** Project structure, Firebase setup, Git/GitHub, dependencies, roadmap
**Claude Code handles:** React components, API endpoints, UI screens, business logic

---

## Prerequisites (One-Time Setup)

```bash
# 1. Install Firebase CLI (required)
npm install -g firebase-tools

# 2. Login to Firebase (required)
firebase login

# 3. Install GitHub CLI (optional but recommended)
# Mac: brew install gh
# Other: https://cli.github.com/
gh auth login

# 4. Verify VS Code CLI (should already work)
code --version
```

**That's it!** No Gemini API key needed. Claude Code handles all AI analysis.

---

## Using with Claude Code (Recommended)

### Method 1: Slash Command

1. **Start Claude Code from parent directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/user  # Parent of firebase-architect
   code .
   ```

2. **In Claude Code, type:**
   ```
   /new-firebase-app
   ```

3. **Answer questions about your app:**
   - Project name and description
   - Platforms (web, mobile, or both)
   - Key features
   - User roles
   - Auth providers
   - Integrations

4. **Tool runs automatically** and sets up everything

5. **Claude Code starts building** your features

---

### Method 2: Natural Language

Just describe what you want:

```
"Build me a Firebase task management app with teams, projects,
real-time collaboration, and mobile support"
```

Claude Code will:
1. Ask clarifying questions
2. Build architecture object
3. Run firebase-architect tool
4. Set up complete environment
5. Start building features from the roadmap

---

**✅ = Generated by tool**
**Empty = Ready for Claude Code to build**

## What's Automated

### Fully Automated (Zero Manual Steps)
- ✅ Complete project structure (monorepo with web/mobile/functions)
- ✅ TypeScript types from your data models
- ✅ Zod validation schemas
- ✅ Firestore security rules (generated)
- ✅ TanStack Query hooks for all CRUD operations
- ✅ Git initialization + first commit
- ✅ Dependency installation
- ✅ Development roadmap generation

### Requires Interaction (1-2 minutes)
- ⚠️ Firebase project creation (tool runs command, may need confirmation)
- ⚠️ GitHub repository creation (if gh CLI installed, requires permission)

### Manual Steps Required (5 minutes)
- ❌ Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- ❌ Enable auth providers in Firebase Console (Google, Email/Password)
- ❌ Add third-party API keys if needed (Stripe, SendGrid, etc.)

**Result: ~85% automated** (most manual work is unavoidable Firebase limitations)

---

## Example Session

```
You: /new-firebase-app

Claude: I'll help you create a new Firebase application!
What should we call this project and what does it do?

You: "TaskMaster - a team task management app with projects and assignments"

Claude: Great! A few more questions:
- Platforms: Web only, mobile only, or both?
- User roles: Any different types like admin vs regular user?
- Auth: How should users sign in (Google, Email, etc.)?

You: Both web and mobile. Yes, admins and regular users.
     Google and Email auth.

Claude: Perfect! Setting up your environment...

📁 Phase 1: Generating project structure...
✅ Project structure created

🔥 Phase 2: Setting up Firebase...
✅ Firebase project created: taskmaster-abc123
✅ Firebase Web App created
✅ Firebase config saved to .env.example

📦 Phase 3: Installing dependencies...
✅ Dependencies installed

🚀 Phase 4: Deploying Firebase resources...
✅ Firestore rules deployed
✅ Firestore indexes deployed

📦 Phase 5: Setting up version control...
✅ Git repository initialized
✅ GitHub repository created: https://github.com/you/taskmaster
✅ GitHub labels created

🎉 Setup Complete!

Project created at: /home/user/taskmaster
Setup time: 45s

Now reading the handoff prompt and starting development...

Claude: I've reviewed your project setup. Everything is ready!
Let me start building the authentication system...
```

---

## Next Steps After Setup

Once the tool finishes:

1. **Review the handoff prompt:**
   ```bash
   # Already open if VS Code auto-opened
   # Or manually:
   cat .claude/HANDOFF_PROMPT.md
   ```

2. **Copy environment file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Start dev servers:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:web      # Web app: http://localhost:5173
   npm run dev:mobile   # Mobile app with Expo
   ```

4. **Let Claude Code build features:**
   - Read `.claude/ROADMAP.md` for the plan
   - Claude implements features step by step
   - Mark tasks complete as you go

---

## Manual Invocation (Without Claude Code)

If you want to run the tool directly:

```bash
cd /home/user/firebase-architect

# Create architecture JSON
cat > /tmp/arch.json <<'EOF'
{
  "projectName": "my-app",
  "displayName": "My App",
  "description": "My awesome Firebase app",
  "projectType": "monorepo",
  "platforms": ["web", "mobile"],
  "features": ["auth", "realtime"],
  "userRoles": [
    {"role": "admin", "permissions": ["*"], "description": "Administrator"},
    {"role": "user", "permissions": ["read", "write"], "description": "Regular user"}
  ],
  "dataModels": [
    {
      "name": "Task",
      "fields": [
        {"name": "title", "type": "string", "required": true},
        {"name": "completed", "type": "boolean", "required": true}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "firebaseServices": ["auth", "firestore"],
  "firebase": {"create": true},
  "github": {"create": true, "visibility": "private"},
  "vscode": {"open": true}
}
EOF

# Run the generator
node run-generator.js "$(cat /tmp/arch.json)"
```

But honestly, **just use Claude Code** - it's way easier!

## Troubleshooting

### "Firebase CLI not found"
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
```

### "Not logged into Firebase"
```bash
firebase login
```

### "gh CLI not found" (Optional)
GitHub repo creation will be skipped. Install if you want automatic GitHub setup:
```bash
# Mac
brew install gh
gh auth login

# Other platforms
# Visit: https://cli.github.com/
```

### "VS Code CLI not found" (Optional)
Project won't auto-open. Just open manually:
```bash
cd your-project
code .
```

### "Firebase project creation failed"
The tool will show manual steps:
1. Go to console.firebase.google.com
2. Click "Add project"
3. Follow prompts
Tool continues automatically after that.

## Key Differences from Old Version

**OLD (v2):**
- ❌ Required Gemini API key
- ❌ Generated application code (React components, etc.)
- ❌ Manual Firebase config copy/paste
- ❌ Template-based (rigid)

**NEW (v3):**
- ✅ No API keys needed
- ✅ Only generates environment setup
- ✅ Auto-fetches Firebase config
- ✅ Claude Code builds custom features
- ✅ Maximum automation (~95%)
