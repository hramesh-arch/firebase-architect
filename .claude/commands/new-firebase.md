# Firebase Architect Setup Wizard

I'll help you create a complete Firebase development environment in /Users/harshithramesh/Builds!

## Workflow

1. I'll ask you questions about your project
2. Build a complete architecture JSON specification
3. Call the firebase-architect generator tool
4. The tool will automatically:
   - Create monorepo structure (web + mobile + functions)
   - Set up Firebase project
   - Generate security rules and types
   - Initialize Git and create GitHub repo
   - Install dependencies
   - Generate development roadmap
   - Open project in VS Code

## Let's Get Started!

**Tell me about your app - what are you building?**

Be specific about:
- What the app does
- Key features
- User types/roles
- Data you'll be managing

Examples:
- "A task management app with teams, projects, and assignments. Admin and regular user roles. Google and email auth."
- "A restaurant ordering system with QR codes. Menu management, orders, and kitchen display. No auth initially."
- "An agent CRM with training modules, client management, and analytics. Admin, agent, and client roles."
