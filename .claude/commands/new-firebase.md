# Firebase Architect - Environment Setup

I'll help you create a complete Firebase development environment!

## What I'll Do

1. **Ask clarifying questions** about your project
2. **Build architecture JSON** with data models, roles, and features
3. **Run the generator** via `run-generator.js`
4. **Auto-generate:**
   - Complete monorepo structure (web + mobile + functions)
   - TypeScript types from your data models
   - Zod validation schemas
   - Firestore security rules with RBAC
   - TanStack Query CRUD hooks
   - Git repository
   - Dependencies installed
   - Development roadmap

5. **You complete (5 min):**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Enable auth providers in Firebase Console

## Let's Start!

**Describe your app in detail:**

Include:
- What the app does
- Key features and workflows
- User types/roles and their permissions
- Data models (what you're managing)
- Auth preferences (Google, Email, etc.)
- Platforms (web only, or web + mobile)

**Examples:**

"A donor CRM for school advancement teams. Track contacts, donations, campaigns, and events. Admin and staff roles. Email and Google auth. Web and mobile."

"A restaurant ordering system with QR codes. Customers scan to view menu and order. Kitchen display for orders. Admin manages menu. No auth for customers. Web only."
